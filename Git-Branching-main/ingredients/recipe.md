##5 MINUTE, TOFU, KALE AND CHICKPEA CURRY

>This is a wonderful quick delicious dinner – **the tofu adds a lovely bite, to contrast with the creamy sauce and chew from the kale** – this is a dish we find ourselves cooking time and time again! Serve with your favourite grain of choice or toasted pitta bread

####INGREDIENTS
* 1 x 400g tin of chickpeas 
* 1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes

1. Drain and dry the tofu to remove any moisture, chop tofu into bite size pieces. Using a knife or your hands remove the tough centre stalk of the kale and roughly chop the leaves. Peel and finely chop the onion or scallions. Finely chop or grate the ginger. Drain and rinse chickpeas.  
2. In a large flat non stick pan heat a little oil on a high heat, when hot add the tofu and cook for 2-3 minutes until nicely browned all over, add 2 tbsp of tamari to the pan along with the onion/scallion, kale and ginger and 1/2 tsp of salt, reduce the heat a little and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the kale starts to wilt, add the curry powder and chilli flake, stirring to coat all the tofu and veg.  
3. Add the coconut milk, chopped tomatoes and chickpeas and bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer for a few minutes. Taste and season if needed to your liking. Serve with wholegrain rice or your favourite naan bread, toasted pita or sides.
